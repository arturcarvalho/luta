## Why?

My son loved watching me play monster train. We started talking about all the super heroes and whatnot in terms of hearts and attack.

We got to a point where we did battles where we'd put little papers on transformers/spiderman/super mario where each one had the hearts and attack stats.

At a given point I also did a little site to compare the hearts. He loved it.

## Development process

The objective is to get to a MFP (minimum fun product) by using PDD (post-it driven development) for optimal acronym density.
