## Why?

My son loved watching me play monster train. We started talking about all the super heroes and whatnot in terms of hearts and attack.

We got to a point where we did battles where we'd put little papers on transformers/spiderman/super mario where each one had the hearts and attack stats.

I started building up this for him to play with. He loves it. 

## Features
- Noisy fights
- Click stats to hear their name
- Tested on ipad, should work on other devices but almost for sure has issues.

## What can you do?

Whatever you want. Try changing the sounds and images with your own. Would love a link back though.

## Development process

The objective is to get to a MFP (minimum fun product) by using PDD (post-it driven development) for OAD (optimal acronym density).
